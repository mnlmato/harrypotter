# Android Kotlin Project with MVVM

This is a sample project written in Kotlin using MVVM, Use Case and the Repository Pattern. The project includes the following test:
- Unit Test with JUnit, MockK and Kotest
- Integration Test with MockWebServer
- Instrumented Test  using the Page Object Pattern

The UI is built with Jetpack Compose, Glide, Animations, Material3 and it supports Dark Mode.

## Project structure

The project follows a modular architecture, separating different concerns into their own modules. The modules are as follows:

- **app:** The main application module.
- **core-app:** The core module responsible for containing the result model and custom exceptions.
- **core-data:** The core data module is responsible for injecting the REST module, the URL provider, and the exceptions mapper.
- **core-ui:** The core UI module is responsible for providing common composable functions, an image loader, a resource provider loader, and ViewModel extensions.
- **design-system:** The design system module is responsible for providing the application theme and base widget components.
- **features:** The features module is responsible for providing the different features in the app.

## Testing

The project has a comprehensive suite of tests:
- Unit test: ViewModel, Use Cases, Repository and Api datasource
- Integration test from ui: Check the flow in the main screen and the data in the second screen.
