# Android Kotlin Project with MVVM

This is a sample project written in Kotlin using MVVM, Use Case and the Repository Pattern.

- The UI is built with Jetpack Compose, Glide, Animations, Material3 and it supports Dark Mode
- The ViewModel is using LiveData and Coroutines
- The Data Layer is using Retrofit and Gson
- The Dependency Injection is implemented with Hilt
- The errors are caught and displayed on a screen with a retry button
- Additionally, the detail screen uses an ID to fetch data from a cache data source
- The build gradle files were migrated to Kotlin
- The dependencies were migrated to version catalogs
- Setup Gradle Convention Plugins
- An easy CI was built using GitHub actions to do the build and run unit tests and screenshot tests


The project includes the following test:

-  Unit Test with JUnit, MockK and Kotest
-  Integration Test with MockWebServer
-  Instrumented Test  using the Page Object Pattern
-  Screenshot tests with Paparazzi

## Project structure

The project follows a modular architecture approach, with a goal of separating different concerns into their own packages. Although the current implementation is not a true modularization, the code has been organized in a way that facilitates future modularization if desired. By separating concerns into modules, the codebase can be maintained more easily and improved independently. This leads to a more scalable and maintainable app, which can evolve over time as new features are added and requirements change.

The packages are as follows:

- **app:** The main application module.
- **core-app:** The core module responsible for containing the result model and custom exceptions
- **core-data:** The core data module is responsible for injecting the REST module, the URL provider, and the exceptions mapper
- **core-ui:** The core UI module is responsible for providing common composable functions, an image loader, a resource provider loader and ViewModel extensions
- **design-system:** The design system module is responsible for providing the application theme and base widget components
- **features:** The features module is responsible for providing the different features in the app

## Testing

The project has a comprehensive suite of tests:

- Unit test: ViewModel, Use Cases, Repository and Api datasource

- Integration test from ui: Check the flow in the main screen and the data in the second screen
